jq4r - jQuery helpers for Rails
====

The Rails framework installed the Prototype.js & Scriptaculous as its default
JavaScript framework and defined many useful helper methods for easing the 
design of JavaScript(especially, AJAX).

jq4r is a Rails plugin, which installs the jQuery JavaScript framework and 
provides useful helper methods, too. I wish this plugin also eases the design
of the javascripts and make your RHTML clean.

Just go to the jq4r project's page, and send me feedbacks if you have 
interesting ideas or suggestions.

==INSTALLATION==

In your <RAILS_APP> directory, type this command:

# script/plugin install http://jq4r.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/plugins/jq4r

Done.

==USAGE==

You should add 

<%= include_jq4r %>

in your pages for using the jq4r's helpers. This code includes the necessary
javascript files in order to help your browser know the jQuery codes.
