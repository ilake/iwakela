JaTinyMce
===========

This plugin based on j_tiny_mce plugin, thanks for his great job, and modify and update this plugin for my project, now this plugin for work with jquery and attachment_fu.

1, Install ja_tiny_mce

cd vendor/plugins
git clone git://github.com/ilake/ja_tiny_mce.git

script/generate ja_tiny_mce_migration
rake db:migrate


2, Install dependent plugins(if you didn't):

rake ja_tiny_mce:plugins

this command would copy attachment_fu, responds_to_parent, will_paginate to your plugin directory, and the jrails you could install it or just include a jquery file

attachment_fu git://github.com/technoweenie/attachment_fu.git
responds_to_parent http://responds-to-parent.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
will_paginate git://github.com/mislav/will_paginate.git
jrails (Recommend) http://ennerchi.com/projects/jrails

Also, you need 'login_required' method and 'current_user' object in your application. (I recommend you use restful_authentication). http://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication/tree/master

3, In your layout:
<%= javascript_include_tiny_mce_if_used %> 
<%= tiny_mce if using_tiny_mce? %>

4, In your controller:

uses_tiny_mce(:options => AppConfig.default_mce_options, :only => [:new, :edit])

This AppConfig.default_mce_options is in config/initializers/tiny_mce_plus_config.rb, you could change the setting there

5. In your view
Then append the following to the text area you want to transform into a TinyMCE editor. You can change the name by editing the ‘editor_selector’ param in the controller code options.

:class => "mceEditor"

6. Install file lists
==================

rake ja_tiny_mce:install 

will Install following files:

app
  |-- controller
    |-- tiny_mce_photos_controller.rb
  |-- helpers
    |-- remote_link_renderer.rb
  |-- models
    |-- tiny_mce_photo.rb
  |-- views
    |-- tiny_mce_photos
       |-- _photo_list.html.erb
config
  |-- initializers
    |-- tiny_mce_plus_config.rb

public
  |-- images
    |-- tiny_mce
  |-- javascripts
    |-- tiny_mce

You may custom the config in tiny_mce_plus_config.rb.

Attention:
1, do not put <p> </p> around the textarea.
2, If you use old will_paginate plugin, maybe change the url_for to url_option in remote_link_renderer.rb
